This project is a two-part wireless system, so the code is organized into two separate Arduino sketches:

/transmitter: This folder contains the code for the wearable sensor unit that is worn on the ankle. 

/receiver: This folder contains the code for the stimulation unit. Its job is to listen for the command from the transmitter and activate the TENS unit.
